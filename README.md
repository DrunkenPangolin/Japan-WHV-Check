# Japan-WHV-Check
Tool for alerting me to the change in status for Japan accepting Working Holiday Visas 

I now intend to make 2 variations of the tool
WHV Manual Check - for launching from my desktop with notifications for all eventualities
WHV Automated - for background checking without notifications if nothing has changed

I use Manjaro so I formatted it in cron using the following as per https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_notifications
