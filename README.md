# japan_whv_check
Tool for alerting me to the change in status for Japan accepting Working Holiday Visas 

I now intend to make 2 variations of the tool
whv_manual_check - for launching from my desktop with notifications for all eventualities
whv_automated - for background checking without notifications if nothing has changed

Note: I use Manjaro so I formatted it in cron as per https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_notifications
